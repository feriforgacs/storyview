          <h4>Use custom text for your Story Button</h4>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/button-text.png" alt="Button text input" class="content-image feature-image" />
          </p>
          <p>Sometimes you need to add a custom copy to a button to increase clicks, make it "pop" or just simply to make it easier to understand for your visitors. That's when it comes handy that you can change the copy of the story view button that you'll embed to your content. If you use the same text most of the time, you can also make your work easier by setting that as the default text for your Story View buttons.</p>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/default-button-text.png" alt="Default story view button text UI" class="content-image feature-image">

          <h4>Create custom button designs for your stories</h4>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/button-designer.png" alt="Story View button designer UI" class="content-image feature-image" />
          </p>
          <p>Although Story View comes with 11 built-in button designs, you can <a href="create-a-custom-button-that-better-fits-your-design.html" target="_blank">create one</a> for yourself so your buttons will fit the design of your website.</p>
          <p>If you know some basic CSS, you can go wild and create a truly custom button for your stories. Or just ask a developer to help you make the necessary changes 😄</p>

          <p>To save some time, you can also set your custom button as the default button for the stories you'll create.</p>

          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/default-button-type.png" alt="Set default button type" class="content-image feature-image">
          </p>

          <p>If you'd like to create a really unique button for your stories, you can also use custom HTML code for your buttons. If you'd like to, this also makes it possible to track the clicks on your story buttons.</p>

          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/custom-button-code.png" alt="Use custom code for story button" class="content-image feature-image">
          </p>

        </div>

        <div class="feature-list__section" id="images">
          <h4>Use static images or gifs in your stories</h4>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/story-image.png" alt="Story image selector" class="content-image feature-image" />
          </p>
          <p>Story View is using the built-in media manager of WordPress to make it easier for you to upload and manage the images you'd like to use to create your stories. This also makes it possible to use not just simple static images but animated GIFs in your stories.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-list__section" id="story-content">
          <h4>Add emojis to your stories</h4>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/story-text.png" alt="Story editor text field" class="content-image feature-image" />
          </p>
          <p>Using emojis in your copies can help you to highlight sections or make them a bit more fun for your visitors. The Story View editor supports the use of emojis, so don't hesitate to use them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-list__section" id="text-position">
          <h4>Set the position and the alignment of the text in your stories</h4>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/text-position.png" alt="Text position selector" class="content-image feature-image" />
          </p>
          <p>Depending on the image you'd like to use in your stories, the position of the text can be crucial when it comes to readability. You can use the built-in text position selector to find the right spot for your content.</p>
          <p>Besides setting the position, you can also change the alignment of your text.</p>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/text-alignment.png" alt="Text alignment options" class="content-image feature-image">
          </p>
          <p>If you use the same alignment setting over and over again, maybe it's worth to set it as the default value for new stories.</p>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/default-text-alignment.png" alt="Default story text alignment" class="content-image feature-image">
          </p>
          <p>And of yourse, it's possible to do the same thing with text positioning.</p>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/default-text-position.png" alt="Default story text position" class="content-image feature-image">
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-list__section" id="font-family">
          <h4>Use different fonts for the text in your stories</h4>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/font-family.png" alt="Font family dropdown" class="content-image feature-image" />
          </p>
          <p>Changing the font family of your text can give a different look for your stories and can also have a positive effect on the experience of your visitors. By supporting 6 popular font families, Story View can help you make your copy look better.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-list__section">
          <h4>Change the color and the background color of your story text</h4>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/colorpicker.png" alt="Colorpicker" class="content-image feature-image">
          </p>
          <p>With the help of the built-in colorpicker, you can set almost any kind of color to the copy of your stories and the background of your text block. By using the right colors, you can make the readability of your stories much better and you can also give a unique look to your content.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-list__section">
          <h4>Find the right font size for your stories</h4>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/font-size.png" alt="Font size selector dropdown" class="content-image feature-image">
          </p>
          <p>You can choose from 5 different font-sizes for the text of your stories. For shorter copy, you can use the bigger fonts, and you also have the option to go with a smaller value when it comes to longer texts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-list__section">
          <h4>Set a background color for your custom story blocks</h4>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/custom-block-settings.png" alt="Custom story block settings" class="content-image feature-image">
          </p>
          <p>Custom story blocks are one of the most powerful features of Story View as they make it possible to add extra functionality to your stories (<a href="add-a-mailchimp-subscription-form-to-your-story-with-the-help-of-custom-story-blocks.html">add a Mailchimp form</a>, <a href="add-a-contact-form-to-your-story-with-the-help-of-custom-story-blocks.html">embed a contact form</a>, <a href="embed-a-youtube-video-to-your-story-with-the-help-of-custom-story-blocks.html">display a YouTube video</a>). You can embed almost any kind of HTML to custom story blocks (Instagram or Facebook posts, Spotify playlists, Tweets, etc) and you can set a background color for the block.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-list__section">
          <h4>Create AMP Stories with a few clicks</h4>
          <p>Google has its <a href="everything-businesses-want-to-know-about-google-amp-stories.html" target="_blank">own version of the story format</a>, it's called AMP Stories. You can easily <a href="create-an-amp-story-from-your-story-view-story.html" target="_blank">create AMP Stories from your Story View stories</a> by providing a few additional information.</p>
          <p>You need to set a cover photo for your AMP Story and with Story View, you can use the built-in WordPress media manager to do that.</p>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/amp-story-cover.png" alt="AMP Story cover upload" class="content-image feature-image">
          </p>
          <p>A publisher logo is also necessary and you can upload that the same way you'd add an image to a simple WordPress post.</p>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/amp-story-publisher-logo.png" alt="AMP Story publisher logo upload" class="content-image feature-image">
          </p>
          <p>Changing the position, font-size, font-family and color of the text on your AMP cover works the same way as with classic story blocks.</p>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/amp-story-cover-text-settings.png" alt="AMP Story cover text settings" class="content-image feature-image">
          </p>

          <p>To make your job easier, you can set up some default settings for your AMP stories, and you can also <strong>track your AMP stories with Google Analytics</strong>:</p>

          <h4>Drive more traffic to your website with social share functions and recommended articles</h4>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/end-screen-share.png" alt="Share settings for end screen" class="content-image feature-image">
          </p>
          <p>The journey of a visitor doesn't end when they reach the last block of your story. You can drive more traffic to your website with the help of them. <a href="enable-social-share-functions-and-recommended-article-on-the-end-screen-of-your-story.html" target="_blank">With the end screen share function</a>, you can display a share button on the end screen of your story so visitors can share your content on their social channels, in email, or anywhere where they can share a link. This can help you acquire new visitors and drive more traffic to your site.</p>
          <p>This is how an end screen looks like with the end screen share function turned on:</p>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/frontend-end-screen.png" alt="Story View end screen with share and recommended articles" class="content-image feature-image">
          </p>
          <p>You can also <a href="enable-social-share-functions-and-recommended-article-on-the-end-screen-of-your-story.html" target="_blank">recommend an other article</a> to your visitors to keep them on your site for a longer period of time.</p>
          <p>With Story View, you can set the URL and the title of your article. You can also give a title to this section so the control is absolutely in your hands.</p>

        <div class="feature-list__section">
          <h4>Use classic controller buttons for easier navigation</h4>
          <p>Although the story format became pretty popular, for some users it could be a bit confusing to navigate between story blocks. That's why we made it possible <a href="enable-story-controllers-for-easier-navigation.html" target="_blank">to display classic controllers</a> in your stories. When they are turned on, your visitors will see two buttons at the bottom of your stories. This will make it more prominent how to go to the next or the previous section of your story.</p>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/story-controllers.png" alt="Story controller settings" class="content-image feature-image">
          </p>
          <p>Of course, you can also change the text on these buttons.</p>

        <div class="feature-list__section">
          <h4>Social share on all your story blocks</h4>
          <p>Besides displaying it on the end screen, you can also <a href="turn-on-social-share-for-all-your-story-blocks.html" target="_blank">turn on the social share feature</a> to be visible on all your story blocks.</p>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/features/social-share-button.png" alt="Social share button settings" class="content-image feature-image">

        <div class="feature-list__section">
          <h4>Display your latest stories with the Story View Widget</h4>
          <p>When it comes to stories, most platforms are displaying them at the top of the screen. <a href="display-your-latest-stories-with-the-story-view-widget.html" target="_blank">You can do something similar</a> with the help of the Story View Widget.</p>
