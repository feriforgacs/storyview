ðŸ‘‹  Hi Everyone,
there is no break on the maker train, here comes my 4th product ðŸ˜¸

I've built Story View to help content creators keep their visitors inside their own platform.

Here is how it works:
- create a post the way you usually do
- select the most important parts and use them to create a highlighted version of your article
- use the simple combination of images and short texts to communicate your message
- enjoy, that users will stay on your site to read the full article because of the highlights

This is just one use case Story View can help you with. It's also perfect to create a step by step guide for a recipe, to highlight the most important parts of an event, to share your favorite scenes or characters from a movie, etc.

As always, looking for your feedback.
