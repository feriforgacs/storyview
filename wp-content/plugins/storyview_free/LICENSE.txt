This plugin is comprised of two parts.

(1) the PHP code and integrated HTML are licensed under the General Public
License (GPL). You will find a copy of the GPL in the same directory as this
text file.

(2) All other parts, but not limited to the CSS code, images, and design are
licensed according to the following terms:

    1. This License grants you, the purchaser, an ongoing, non-exclusive, worldwide license to make use of the digital work (Item) you have selected. Read the rest of this license for the details that apply to your use of the Item.
    2. You are licensed to use the Item to create one single End Product for yourself or for one client (a “single application”), and the End Product can be distributed for Free.
    3. An End Product is a work that incorporates the Item as well as other things, so that it is larger in scope and different in nature than the Item.
    4. You can create one End Product for a client, and you can transfer that single End Product to your client for any fee. This license is then transferred to your client.
    5. You can make any number of copies of the single End Product, as long as the End Product is distributed for Free.
    6. You can modify or manipulate the Item. You can combine the Item with other works and make a derivative work from it. The resulting works are subject to the terms of this license. You can do these things as long as the End Product you then create is permitted under clause 3.
    7. You can’t Sell the End Product, except to one client. (If you or your client want to Sell the End Product, you will need to get in touch with the author for approval.)
    8. You can’t re-distribute the Item as stock, in a tool or template, or with source files. You can’t do this with an Item either on its own or bundled with other items, and even if you modify the Item. You can’t re-distribute or make available the Item as-is or with superficial modifications. These things are not allowed even if the re-distribution is for Free.
    9. You can’t use the Item in any application allowing an end user to customise a digital or physical product to their specific needs, such as an “on demand”, “made to order” or “build it yourself” application. You can use the Item in this way only if you purchase a separate license for each final product incorporating the Item that is created using the application.
    10. Although you can modify the Item and therefore delete unwanted components before creating your single End Product, you can’t extract and use a single component of an Item on a stand-alone basis.
    11. You must not permit an end user of the End Product to extract the Item and use it separately from the End Product.
    12. You can’t use an Item in a logo, trademark, or service mark.
    13. You can only use the Item for lawful purposes.
